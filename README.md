possum is a system for interpreting “black box” models through POSterior
SUMmarization, as described by Woody, Carvalho, and Murray (2021; see
[*JCGS*
paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2020.1796684?journalCode=ucgs20)
or [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07103)). You simply
provide the data inputs for your model and the model results, and possum
will print out a model summary.
